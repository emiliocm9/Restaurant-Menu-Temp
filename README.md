# Restaurant Menu Web Application

A web application developed for restaurants to improve their customer service during this pandemic period. The restaurant owner could log in and change the restaurant menu by just uploading menu pictures. The customer could open the menu just using a smartphone with internet connection.

> This repo includes the code for the Restaurant Page. Github user could download the code and use it to generate a new web-page with new properties as the user could want.
